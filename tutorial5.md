# Tutorial 5: OML Sirius # {#tutorial5}

Note: This tutorial builds on the project developed in [Tutorial 1](#tutorial1). Please do that first before proceeding.

## Learning Objectives ## {#tutorial5-learning-objectives}

In this tutorial, we will learn how the [Sirius](https://eclipse.dev/sirius/) framework can be used to ease authoring OML models in the Rosetta workbench. This can effectively lower the bar for OML users, especially those who may prefer not to work with the OML textual syntax directly. 

By the end of the tutorial, the user should be able to:

1. Use the built-in OML diagram editors as an alternative to the OML text editor to author OML models.
2. Create custom editors to support user-friendly domain-specific authoring for OML description models.

Note: The tutorial also shows how the openCAESAR's implementation of OML, which is built on top the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF), allows leveraging the huge EMF ecosystem of tools, while adding more rigourous and agile analysis capabilities to a DSL.
