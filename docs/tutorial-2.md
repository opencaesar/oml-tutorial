# Tutorial 2: OML Patterns # {#tutorial2}

Note: If you have not already done so, please do [Tutorial 1](#tutorial1) first before doing this one since we assume your familiarity with the basics of OML.

## Learning Objectives ## {#tutorial2-learning-objectives}
This tutorial demonstrates the process of developing a methodology for capturing knowledge in a given business domain with OML. The methodology will be developed as a series of patterns, each of which repersents a small step in the methodology, and is encoded by some new vocabulary. As an example, we will develop a simple systems engineering methodology.

The tutorial also demonstrates describing knowledge using instances of those patterns and organizing them into modules that capture related concerns. As an example, we will describe a fanciful space mission called Kepler16b, which is an exoplanet orbiting a binary star system called Kepler16 .. approximately 245 light-years from Earth.
