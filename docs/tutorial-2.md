## Learning Objectives ## {#tutorial2-learning-objectives}
This tutorial demonstrates the process of developing a methodology for capturing knowledge in a given business domain with OML. It covers developing a set of patterns for describing knowledge and encoding them as vocabularies. It also involves organizing the description of knowledge in separate modules based on those patterns. As an example, we will develop a simple systems engineering vocabulary, and use it to describe the architecture of simple (hypothetical) space mission called Kepler16b.
