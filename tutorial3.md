# Tutorial 3: OML Reports # {#tutorial3}

Note: This tutorial builds on the project developed in [Tutorial 2](#tutorial2). Please do that first before proceeding.

## Learning Objectives ## {#tutorial3-learning-objectives}
The ability to create a model is not complete without the ability to analyze it and share the result of analysis with stakeholders. In Tutorial 3, we saw how OML models can be analyzed with SPARQL queries and the results visualized but we did not show how we created those visualizations. This tutorial builds on this and teaches the following analyzes skills:

- How to analyze SPARQL query results further
- How to visualize analysis results
- How to mix visualizations with narrative text,
- How to package all analysis in a notebook to present to stakeholders.

Note: The source files created in this tutorial are available for reference in this [repository](https://github.com/opencaesar/kepler16b-example), but we encourage the reader to recreate them by following the instructions below.
